# Copy this file and use it as a reference when setting up Railway
# Railway will automatically provide DATABASE_URL in their dashboard

# After creating PostgreSQL on Railway, you'll get a DATABASE_URL like:
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:password@containers-us-west-xxx.railway.app:5432/railway

# Use this URL in:
# 1. Vercel environment variables (for backend)
# 2. Local development (temporarily, to run migrations)
